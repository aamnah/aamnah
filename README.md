### Hi 👋 I'm Amna. 

I'm an amazing generalist because of my curiosity. I have hands-on experience with frontend development and have built apps with React. Plus i'm taking courses for ethical hacking, cyber defence, advanced programming and cloud operations. Being a student allows me to explore new roles before deciding on a specialization. Open to networking and opportunities. Let's connect!

- 🖥️  See my portfolio at [aamnah.com](http://aamnah.com)
- 🔭 I’m currently working on finishing my ICT degree at JAMK
- 👯 I’m looking to join on a development team that works on projects that create an impact
- 🌱 I’m currently learning C++ and low level programming
